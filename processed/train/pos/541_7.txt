sequel bad movie actually better st one found entertaining like shot documentary style first thought low budget grew made movie seem authentic movie dry one liner original good thing opinion think time went bit top scene character almost becomes parody may point movie least suspense st one view great music original great acting pretty decent part though like said top also felt movie lot momentum towards end minute seem really slow seem flow like rest movie overall though thought pretty sequel rating return cabin lake
