watch cage appreciate actor watching movie see really fit genre movie coming early really think considered film noir pretty dark time due mostly lighting odd personality character typical performance three main actor good job role thought however hopper character left undeveloped sometimes hard understand hopper love hate kind guy plot really good although found part unrealistic part hand director e first see sheriff movie definitely worth watching
