wonderfully written well psychological drama really horror flick looking something like ring grudge disappointed really film intelligence subtle attention detail plot effort made internally consistent also absence new age revisionism rather advancing agenda told story told well let viewer think sparse reminiscent painting amazingly effective great example make good film small budget without big studio star actor big name director far better many film special effect clever plot twist
