think dark angel great first season excellent good plot alba x manticore creation trying adapt normal life still saving world manticore throughout season give series extra spice second season though suddenly bit odd first plot kind series lost little charm mostly weird creature get wrong second season good little bit much manticore however get back new promising plot episode season lot hope see really wish could start making new episode behind cannot go wrong conclusion would say great series however still third season
