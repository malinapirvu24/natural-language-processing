found charming adaptation lively full fun exception couple major error cast wonderful echo comment horribly miscast old yes show lack singing chop broadway style music decent enough singer non dancer adequate however character definitely also strident throughout get tiresome girl sweet apple birdie fan club really sparkle special kudos also performance though generally fan work finally dancing riot especially three bar movie suitable whole family highly recommend
