first watching anime never thought something making bread could actually interesting thankfully mistaken moment watching anime world bread making hooked biggest advantage anime humor intelligent funny recurring gag animation character development average disadvantage seen much first episode great job anime really start show last episode reaction recurring gag grow old funny far concerned anime ended episode would given last episode leave bitter aftertaste sadly cannot washed away awesome episode
