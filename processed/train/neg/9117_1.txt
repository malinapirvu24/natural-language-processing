maybe bad plot cheap rehash first weird since supposed sequel pretty much entire movie like cheap remake first scene thing first lot ridiculous unlikely first great cast one consist b list actor reject acting mostly horrendously bad half good line movie taken directly first nearly every major character one first movie realize made series pilot episode excuse turn bad footage movie one thing marginally good erotic sequence however nowhere near good one first even raising rating chance see free straight guy could worth want something erotic avoid cost
