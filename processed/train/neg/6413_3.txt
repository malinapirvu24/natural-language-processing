friend went movie knowing expect best came slightly informed plot movie actually though worst movie ever seen definitely recommend spending money see theater maybe friend rent even worth rental cost either really want see movie convoluted idea going last five minute really much said defense acting decent would expect get movie shot good lame plot poor script movie actually bad soon got went ticket see good movie cleanse mind recommend skip first step go see good movie instead
