promising first minute make feel warm inside pretty convinced great romantic comedy movie take turn worse warm feeling might still said plot becomes unbelievable artificial almost unbearable watch movie get sped get impression either fast forwarding producer decided fit h cut lot scene realism goal onto viewer pretty convinced comedy intentionally unrealistic plus side movie couple nice interior despite bad script think actor performance mainly good could rate first minute would probably give eight get four nice sucker romantic comedy probably great time anyways would recommend watch something else
