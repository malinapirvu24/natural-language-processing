looking forward seeing quite raving review nomination medium attention must say first quarter movie good really black music scene back however movie wore whole family wit singing kept coming one mean seriously one music number would broke even rent furthermore hardly character development character care even murphy character drug overdose knew sad could feel emotion character character given flimsy background singing childhood whatnot personality revealed enough draw finally conflict simply significant enough make viewer care go along lack character development movie copy cat movie based ray rent ray wonderful movie opinion overall think movie would best suit someone really care overall story yet would enjoy two hour entertaining fun singing performance
