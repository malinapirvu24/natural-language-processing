evil alien huge debt peter early film bad taste must confess never enjoying film particularly say jake west director clearly lack inspiration steal look lost count amount time major film notably alien amount blood gore show funny either latter end film becomes tired dragged maybe would worked better short film actor poor direction weak plot non existent see director trying homage trying pay done thing lot better
