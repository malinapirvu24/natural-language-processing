probably one slasher movie ever badly badly written plot five student behind holiday dorm somebody design start killing one one main suspect creepy woody roll could one five character acting bad great either apart way quickly main heroine rest well quite dull although laura main heroine sometimes charm feel sorry end kill cannot really see kill look fake mostly one guy hand sliced half beginning look really fake quite nasty like one girl get head run car one girl get boiled alive another get burned alive overall really great slasher could lot better
