generally found hear movie prior seeing probably good reason movie blockbuster day saw shelf since good movie already rented one see anyway figured would give one shot really much different movie genre single ward r type movie probably enjoy however mormon movie probably appeal way avoid overtly religious mormon message within time come across sappy cheesy ultimately fall within mormon demographic probably better watching something else admittedly funny moment film think enough salvage movie overall
