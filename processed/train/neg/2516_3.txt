sadly remember book recall story film typical german production low quality hold attention although story good badly center misery character overly exaggerated nuance performance even well known german actor eddy cannot rescue poor spectacle however hope told film following one getting better better conclusion must say film deserve cinematic screen may enough lazy afternoon
