despite flaw cigarette burn carpenter season one episode master horror series yes story like cheap cross mouth madness still quite good budget time constraint given pro life however low budget time constraint definitely show anything else solid always carpenter yet quality writing whole production give feeling made total complete rush script always clear message fuzzy story full plot hole look back maybe carpenter written script could episode instead mess carpenter fan find enjoyment definitely worst carpenter ever done
