rented good western film pretty scene reasonable idea bad problem film first part exactly bad guy kill mine owner really connected movie except establish bad bank employee gone bad act poorly convincingly decide hire killer employer least keep u guessing character bank owner bank employee long delay much anything happening absurd premise martin still see judge gang killing law even absurd judge judge listen sheriff guy even ridiculous martin hung rope break sheriff take finally head back town save wife bad bank employee would return quick dispatch gang save wife arrest bad bank guy send judge note gang trail overall sad acting point movie
