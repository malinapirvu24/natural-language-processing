honestly alone dark bad could hardly believe seeing character stereotype wandering around getting extent character development giving character name occupation real plot none character motivation fact many action scene coming nowhere pounding track watching movie kept happening going acting high school drama quality stiff wooden delivery though actor reading cue card without line trouble line made even obvious horrible sound design like open room actor constantly taking obvious care hit mark looking almost movement listless automaton series implausible scenario often without even benefit transition scene happening happening random scene little rhyme reason lot fun watching definitely worth nine buck though
