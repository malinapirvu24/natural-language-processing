film rather disappointment slow intense quite gory beginning film begin lose much plot leaf little time explanation coming theater character remain shallow story convincing v stuff without hint parody cheesy part like young cop dig body course night rain alone yawn manifestation evil plus genetic manipulation wow really original nice bit though like scene mountain view running gag though vincent definitely worth
