incredible terrible many level script acting choice cast appalling costume set pseudo medieval language also utterly awful odd way actually film accepted going good shame people would spend much time effort something poor really could made something pretty decent premise albeit believable instead rather cheesy tale dragon knight lack charm found fantasy film let u hope lord ring bit better oh haircut make look like man
