play modern day crime solve brutal slaying local girl pat wrote directed b flick especially well made however surprisingly serious minded regard leading character appealing successful carving interesting young woman despite picture undermining supporting cast bad though violence last act go overboard cheesy camp fest nothing exceptionally memorable either
