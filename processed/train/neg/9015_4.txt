first minute dragon fighter entirely acceptable surprisingly watchable character believable interesting lab look really high tech collapse character start idiotically new subplot nowhere fusion reactor supposedly present day going critical plot justification kill dragon finish incredibly weak one wonder made movie well turn wrong character except dean cain result weird situation detail like character bailey kent despite heavy accent despite one occasion inexplicably switching decent start considered rating movie really disappointing give
