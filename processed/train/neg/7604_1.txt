sure take place west title make seem like conventional western instead movie woman sheriff make mistake though bad movie woman sheriff becomes sheriff husband tad bit upset main goal go villain also woman villain hire guy kill hero fall love killer vice utterly stupid anyone movie new sheriff thank chance put killer behind bar guess would killer also mayor town personal reason also rather dumb movie boring really worth watching one better episode made imagine anyone seeing without would make much painful low budget director even know better people go one place coming another
