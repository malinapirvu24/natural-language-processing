quick undead finally first movie actually render null void essentially one gigantic plot hole aside acting quite bad character motivation nonexistent unbelievable single character worth hanging hat interesting cast member great potential dark horse protagonist got halfway proceeding quick undead serve excellent example good color timing excellent take account budget consideration unfortunately play like guy got hand hundred grand watched western notably good bad ugly threw bunch element haphazardly movie know movie character fit care movie maybe good view cinematographer colorist first year film otherwise must miss
