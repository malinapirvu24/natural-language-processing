honestly bad movie great one either story tell told incoherent way kind make loose full meaning ability intrigue movie could made another way outstanding result story interesting yet somehow watching definitely amateur movie rather opposite scene really emotional actor actress quite good job director something unfinished whole movie cannot quite put finger perhaps gotten know character messiness movie could better put action throughout slow time time
