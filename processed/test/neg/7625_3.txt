weird movie yet rating box say rated r nothing movie would remotely qualify r rating aside though movie slow pointless mean idea good nothing done mildly creepy acting actually quite good better movie see watching soon ever movie dealing concept better made one seen many craven film cannot really compare movie though think poorly poorly executed cannot give chiller higher rating
