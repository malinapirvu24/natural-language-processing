good show animated otherwise however annoying nth degree reason particular order first one pointless annoying character ever character serf purpose show whatsoever maybe intended comic relief work way next joker thought really ridiculous character let loose ridiculous laugh almost every sentence talk repetitive get old really fast also think right actor voice character sound like joker sound lastly made robin look like complete problem show bad big enough problem drastically lower likability factor new adventure batman best
