could ignore show watching season one struck really good hooked episode spiral first act complete idiot confirming obviously spewing semi random stuff great expectation somehow becoming next best joke got stunning look think lip explore part face normally never go making strange grimace accentuate everything say hilarious way track maybe thought character would flat faded make colorful spicy made flood color spice scream loud attention hurt eye ear intellect really really love show like said premise great come shelf fabulous destiny lee pretty good job along actor way would get forget show extreme character abruptly wake show worth note character acting would fine something part series get much screen time
