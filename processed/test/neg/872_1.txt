thought one worst movie ever volunteer watch end romance believable character love affair made hardly sense miscast scenery absolutely stupid either opinion like family go vacation creepy gypsy cheesy look typically like house surf would spend night one hurricane also realistic give plenty notice batten hatch also friend superfluous match story civil war anyway also mention wardrobe lane scarf pashmina shawl every scene overdone good enough hide thing without making obvious like light slack lastly concerned impact everyone dispose stupid mean stupid movie fall one even watchable
