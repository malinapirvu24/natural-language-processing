much really like zeta remake good movie version tension passion mostly clear rip convincing hurting child love could believe abigail role unfortunately zeta found another one could role good vulnerable joyful passionless comparison version pleasant bland love perhaps predictable satisfying therapist added interesting bit color seem important end said would back movie returned mostly home every revisit
