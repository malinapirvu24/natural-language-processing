movie good pretty stupid pretty annoying poorly done really saw film one friend said film although hate much still found pretty bad film thing remotely good little entertaining time also feel done little better would equally mean little better totally recast like shot film festival script would slasher film instead instead film acting atrocious felt watching couple teen act like show thrill ride something kill pretty cheap film basically everything else low class overall film really bad would missing anything decided skip film star
