hard live first commandment movie grandiose personally fan wow movie series disappointing even animated prince better one thing threw version version weak un like acting really great modern adaptation something better look stunning visually first one guess running tight budget something occasional voice narrator found strange unnecessary also broke flow story um god voice line kind weird
