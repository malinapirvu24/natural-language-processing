read film line seeing generally positive review received trailer decided check disappointment start well enough opening scene actually pretty tense downhill see trying something different movie took enjoyment watching choice combined c use music montage lack suspense scare humor really drag film much many subtle clue first twist early already know movie going end gave movie three star think cast good job cannot recommend movie
