great gangster flick brilliant performance well known actor great action scene well one rather amazing see wide cast well known actor many good movie movie without doubt may one worst could possibly appear first plot would expect average gangster biography nothing new nothing fancy way told make movie look lot longer thought two hour almost quite minute action scene look lot like y series team example y team scene far sophisticated el especially fun see guy point gun air still hit something talk people take cover behind car door later look like shot acting fit quite nicely action either get reaction everything style may think parody unfortunately advise stay away movie gangster movie better one
