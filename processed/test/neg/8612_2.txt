firstly admit seen vampire seen original vampire film love rented film nothing expect love idea shifting action far east lot new avenue action sequence well story line enough made fight scene chase painfully boring part like way slayer team shown heroic good guy first movie would since saw old hammer movie legend golden vampire year ago someone would one day make another good based vampire film
