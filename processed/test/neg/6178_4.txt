saw movie rating back thought wow must good one thought wrong beginning movie actually keep plot promise go exponentially underneath basement think without character nix might alright although reason story line take course character extreme liking hard endure also journey main character take beginning story till climax end partly irrelevant could easily alternative understand movie although must admit easy watching problem sitting whole movie finished somewhat unimpressed ending rather mediocre
