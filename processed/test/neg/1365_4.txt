admit big fan satanic horror movie fact seem like every time see new one really surprising end watching film like brotherhood satan despite low rating hear good thing film expectation went turned big mistake exactly film rating namely bad one plot basic bunch satanist causing trouble focus small town people really clear naturally satanist behind bad news mother father daughter road trip become trapped mysterious town feeling film might along line satanist flick devil rain quite silly later film much better either plot fairly earth also rather boring cannot say movie brotherhood satan obviously fan one film see reason recommend
