watching movie never thought would honest enough much plot real character latch onto except killer acting better capable know three ten stellar review saying shot poorly completely useless think set supposed fairly well lighting minimal time natural audience used supposed top look like snuff film fact time quality probably still high true nobody would make minute camera work truly bad particularly scary disturbing time one two character come across believable get tiring time overall put together cleaner lot movie
