like cable company summary interesting watched twice already probably early part difficult follow later clear believe screenwriter good job tying loose end acting unconvincing maybe always kind double cross case poor acting would insincerity character fit well important theme carnival owner money local casino snake charmer wife want steal terrible life could help get plot twist probably reason loose end think mystery something else happen score mostly plot say like spoiler want one believe film worth time
